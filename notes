Szenarios:
1. Corner without other robots
2. On the field with other robots
3. One without obstacles (no victim)
4. One without obstacles (with single victim)
5. One without obstacles  (triple victim)


Task permutation:
1. Multiple navigation before control
2. Just a single triple of navigation, control, bump

Notes: Bump sometimes doesn't get recognized when bumping into other robots

Periods:
Task 1: <= 1300
Task 2: >= 300
Task 3: >= 300
Task 4: <= 1000
Task 5: <= 1000
Task 6: <= 1000 // Difference between Refine & Report and Communicate must be <= 1300
Task 7: <= 150

Task 2 and 3 run together (same period)

Attempt 1:
We run avoid every 100ms.
Then minor cycle = 100ms, mayor cycle = 600.

Periods:
Task 1: = 600 
Task 2: = 300
Task 3: = 300
Task 4: = 200
Task 5: = 200
Task 6: = 200 // Difference between Refine & Report and Communicate must be <= 1300
Task 7: = 100

Attempt 2:
